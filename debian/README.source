gcc-mingw-w64 for Debian
------------------------

Building gcc-mingw-w64 from scratch requires several steps.

1. Build the bootstrap gcc package which will allow mingw-w64 to be built:
	cd debian
	ln -sf rules.bootstrap rules.variant
	ln -sf control.bootstrap control
	cd ..
	dpkg-buildpackage
2. Install the resulting gcc-mingw-w64-bootstrap package.
3. Build the mingw-w64 package (see its README.source file for more
   details).
4. Install the mingw-w64 package.
5. Build the full gcc package:
	cd debian
	fakeroot debian/rules clean
	ln -sf rules.full rules.variant
	ln -sf control.full control
	dpkg-buildpackage

Note that once mingw-w64 is available (it's an architecture "all"
package), building the gcc package no longer requires this series of
steps.

Also note that the patch in http://bugs.debian.org/600502 needs to be
applied to gcc-4.5-source.
