gcc-mingw-w64 (5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add the DMUA flag set by Didier Raboud to the control.source file.
  * Add a warning to the generated debian/control file indicating that
    it shouldn't be modified directly.
  * Fix the version for Breaks/Replaces at 4.6.3-3+4, since this is the
    earliest version of the post-split package in the archive. Fixing
    the version avoids making the package set uninstallable.

gcc-mingw-w64 (4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stephen Kitt ]
  * Split package into gcc, g++, gfortran and gnat packages.
  * Enable the Objective-C and Objective-C++ compilers.
  * Split package into 32- and 64-bit specific versions (-i686 and
    -x86-64) - see thread starting at
    http://lists.debian.org/4EBA730A.7060707@greffrath.com for rationale.
  * Build with gcc-4.6 explicitly, at least until gnat-4.7 is available
    (Closes: #667173).
  * Standards-Version 3.9.3, no change required.
  * Provide a transitional gcc-mingw32 package for backwards-
    compatibility (Closes: #644769); in addition, with regards to bugs
    filed against gcc-mingw32:
    - gcc-mingw-w64's version of mm_malloc.h is correct (Closes: #651300);
    - gcc-mingw-w64 compiles programs (Closes: #658619);
    - gcc-mingw-w64 provides shared versions of libgcc and libstdc++
      (Closes: #540783);
    - the packages' dependency structure ensures that the various compiler
      packages depend on the appropriate development packages (Closes:
      #567698).
  * Update debian/copyright using the version provided by gcc-4.6.

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Confidently set the DM-Upload-Allowed flag to yes.

gcc-mingw-w64 (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable Ada support on armhf and hurd-i386 for now, based on a patch
    by Peter Green (Closes: #658526).
  * Wrap-and-sort debian/control.full.
  * Check before moving libraries, when bootstrapping there is nothing
    to move.
  * Update debian/control.bootstrap with changes made to
    debian/control.full.
  * Add spelling fix for "writting".

gcc-mingw-w64 (2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Export all relevant flags from dpkg-buildflags; in particular this
    allows building with a stack-protector-enabling compiler (as on
    Ubuntu).

gcc-mingw-w64 (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include Ada support (Closes: #632375). Build-depend on gcc-4.6-source
    4.6.1-5 or later to get the required upstream fixes.
  * Stop trying to ship libiberty, upstream no longer supports it
    (Closes: #634567).
  * Protect intrinsics in C++ code (Closes: #633552).
  * Provide shared versions of DLL-compatible libraries (Closes:
    #625778). The appropriate DLLs may have to be shipped with the
    resulting binaries, unless static build options are used (-static,
    -static-libgcc and/or -static-libstdc++).
  * Re-organise configure flags and update them as used upstream.
  * Switch to single-number versions and add the gcc-mingw-w64 version to
    the resulting binary package's version.
  * Disable hardening with dpkg-dev >= 1.16.1 for now (until the gcc-4.6
    package supports it).
  * Correct uses of "informations" in output code.

gcc-mingw-w64 (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship libiberty (Closes: #626117).
  * Enable fully dynamic strings (Closes: #626956).
  * Switch to gcc 4.6.
  * Install the LTO plugin (Closes: #625901).
  * Require binutils 2.21.51.20110523 to avoid LTO-related segfaults (see
    http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12693 for details).
  * Avoid attempting to build libstdc++-pic.a.
  * Drop leading "The" from the package description.
  * Strip the libraries.
  * Build-depend on libcloog-ppl-dev to enable extra optimisations.
  * Link with "--as-needed" to limit dependencies to those actually
    needed.

gcc-mingw-w64 (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow building on all architectures.
  * Enable LTO support (Closes: #623711).
  * Standards-Version 3.9.2, no change required.

 -- Stephen Kitt <steve@sk2.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2011 23:54:55 +0200

gcc-mingw-w64 (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #602997).
